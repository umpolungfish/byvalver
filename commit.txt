feat: Add Windows PIC-shellcode generation capabilities

This commit introduces comprehensive Position Independent Code (PIC) generation functionality to byvalver, enabling the creation of position-independent shellcode for Windows environments.

## Summary of Changes:

### New Features:
- Added `--pic` command-line flag to generate position-independent shellcode
- Implemented JMP-CALL-POP technique for runtime EIP/RIP register access
- Created PEB-based kernel32.dll base address discovery mechanism
- Added foundation for hash-based Windows API resolution
- Integrated anti-debugging features in generated PIC shellcode

### Architecture:
- Created new module `src/pic_generation.c` and `src/pic_generation.h`
- Implemented using existing strategy pattern for consistency
- Added proper error handling and memory management
- Ensured seamless integration with existing pipeline

### Integration:
- Full compatibility with existing biphasic processing (--biphasic)
- Works with XOR encoding (--xor-encode) and decoder stubs
- Maintains all existing null-byte elimination guarantees
- Preserves functional equivalence of original shellcode

### Technical Implementation:
- Uses modified djb2 hash algorithm for API name resolution
- Implements safe PEB traversal for dynamic API discovery
- Generates minimal PIC stubs with automated addressing
- No dependency on import address table (IAT) for API calls

### Usage Examples:
- `./bin/byvalver --pic input.bin output.bin`
- `./bin/byvalver --pic --biphasic input.bin output.bin`
- `./bin/byvalver --pic --xor-encode 0x12345678 input.bin output.bin`

### Quality Assurance:
- Fixed all compiler warnings and errors
- Verified functionality with real shellcode samples
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing features
- Comprehensive documentation updates

This enhancement significantly extends byvalver's capabilities for generating advanced shellcode that can execute from any memory location while maintaining all existing null-byte elimination and obfuscation features.
