Files Modified:
===============

- WHITEPAPER.md - Expanded references section (lines 996-1037)

Rationale:
==========

A comprehensive technical whitepaper requires proper academic citations
to support its claims and provide readers with resources for deeper
study. The expanded references:

- Cover all major technical domains discussed in the paper
- Include foundational academic papers from top security venues
- Reference authoritative architecture documentation
- Cite relevant tools and frameworks mentioned in the text
- Provide both theoretical and practical resources

The categorized organization improves readability and helps readers
locate references relevant to their specific interests.
