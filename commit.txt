fix: Address ML strategist prediction tracking issue

## Summary
This commit fixes the issue where the ML strategist was showing "Predictions Made: 0" in the metrics output despite processing thousands of instructions. The neural network was being used for strategy reprioritization but predictions weren't being properly recorded in the metrics system.

## Problem Analysis
The ML strategist was using the neural network for strategy selection and reprioritization via ml_reprioritize_strategies function, but the ml_metrics_record_prediction function was never being called anywhere in the codebase. This resulted in the metrics showing zero predictions even when ML was actively being used for decision making.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Prediction Recording in Strategy Registry
Modified the get_strategies_for_instruction function in src/strategy_registry.c to:
- Call ml_get_strategy_recommendation when ML mode is enabled
- Record the prediction using ml_metrics_record_prediction
- Access the global metrics tracker via a new get_ml_metrics_tracker function

### 2. Metrics Tracker Access Function
Added a new function get_ml_metrics_tracker() in src/ml_strategist.c that:
- Returns a reference to the global ML metrics tracker
- Allows other modules to access metrics for recording predictions
- Added corresponding declaration in src/ml_strategist.h

### 3. Header Dependencies
Updated src/ml_strategist.h to include ml_metrics.h so the new function declaration works properly.

## Key Changes Made

### src/strategy_registry.c (+15 lines):
- Modified get_strategies_for_instruction to call ml_get_strategy_recommendation
- Added logic to record predictions when ML is used for strategy selection
- Used get_ml_metrics_tracker() to access metrics system

### src/ml_strategist.c (+8 lines):
- Added get_ml_metrics_tracker() function to return global metrics tracker
- Properly handles NULL cases for safety

### src/ml_strategist.h (+3 lines):
- Added declaration for get_ml_metrics_tracker() function
- Included ml_metrics.h to access the tracker type

## Result
After this fix:
- ML strategist now properly records predictions in the metrics system
- "Predictions Made" count accurately reflects the number of ML-based decisions
- Metrics summary shows meaningful prediction statistics instead of zeros
- All existing functionality remains unchanged

## Testing
- Verified build completes successfully with no new warnings
- Confirmed that ML mode now records non-zero prediction counts
- Validated that all existing functionality remains intact
- Tested that metrics are properly exported to JSON and CSV formats

## Impact
This fix resolves the main issue reported where ML strategist showed 0 predictions despite processing many instructions. The neural network is now properly tracked in the metrics system, providing accurate feedback on ML model usage and performance.
