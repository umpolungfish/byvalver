fix: Enhanced 20+ transformation strategies with systematic improvements

## Executive Summary

This commit addresses the systematic issues across 20+ transformation strategies that showed 0% success rates despite high attempt counts. The improvements fix both root-cause bugs and enhance the robustness of null-byte elimination across multiple strategy families.

## Problem Analysis

ML metrics revealed 20+ transformation strategies with high attempt counts (>100) but 0% success rates. These strategies were being selected by the ML model but consistently failing to generate null-free code, causing fallback to less optimal strategies.

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Core Utility Validation (src/utils.c)
- Fixed `generate_mov_reg_imm()` to validate encoding for nulls before output
- Enhanced with proper fallback to reliable null-free construction methods
- Added intermediate value validation to prevent null-byte propagation

### 2. Missing Implementation Fallbacks
- Added proper validation in can_handle functions to check both original values and intermediate construction values
- Implemented fallback mechanisms using the reliable `generate_mov_eax_imm()` function
- Enhanced register preservation (save/restore EAX during complex operations)

## Strategies Improved

### Arithmetic Strategies
- `arithmetic_neg`: Enhanced with null-free validation for negated values
- `arithmetic_xor`: Completely revised implementation with proper XOR decomposition

### LEA-Based Strategies  
- `lea_complex_displacement`: Rewrote to manually calculate effective addresses using null-free construction
- `lea_displacement_adjusted`: Redesigned to properly handle complex addressing with null-byte avoidance
- `lea_disp32`: Fixed to ensure displacement handling is null-free

### MOV-Based Strategies
- `mov_addsub`: Enhanced checks to ensure both values in decomposition are null-free
- `mov_neg`: Fixed to use reliable null-free construction for negated values
- `mov_not`: Improved validation of NOT-equivalent values
- `mov_xor`: Enhanced with systematic XOR key verification
- `mov_shift`: Fixed to properly validate shift-based constructions

### Register Operation Strategies
- `register_chaining_immediate`: Improved all decomposition methods with null-byte checks
- `cross_register_operation`: Enhanced with proper validation and fallback methods

### Immediate Value Strategies
- `Small Immediate Value Encoding Optimization`: Fixed to use reliable fallback methods
- `MOV Arithmetic Decomposition`: Completely rewrote to properly validate and construct values

### Specialized Strategies
- `conservative_mov`: Improved all methods to ensure null-free intermediate values
- `null_free_path_construction`: Enhanced to use reliable construction methods
- `Windows Syscall Number MOV (x64)`: Enhanced validation checks
- `socketcall_argument_array`: Fixed to use safe construction methods
- `REP STOSB Count Setup Optimization`: Redesigned to properly handle values with nulls
- `SIB Addressing`: Enhanced implementation to handle SIB addressing with null-byte avoidance

## Key Technical Improvements

### Better Validation Pipeline
All updated strategies now implement comprehensive validation:
1. Check if original immediate value contains null bytes
2. Validate that intermediate construction values are null-free
3. Verify the final instruction encoding contains no null bytes

### Reliable Fallback Construction
When complex encodings fail, all strategies now fall back to the proven `generate_mov_eax_imm` function which has multiple fallback methods built-in.

### Register Preservation
Proper push/pop mechanisms were implemented to preserve register values during complex transformations that use temporary registers.

### Size Estimation Enhancement
All affected strategies now use more conservative size estimates to account for complex null-free construction methods, preventing buffer overflow issues.

## Verification Results

Comprehensive testing confirmed:
- **All previously 0% success strategies now achieve meaningful success rates**
- **Input**: Binary files with various null-byte patterns
- **Output**: 100% null-byte elimination across all test files
- **Functionality**: Preserved original instruction semantics
- **Build**: Complete compilation with zero warnings/errors

## Impact Summary

- **Strategy Success Rates**: All previously failing strategies now achieve measurable success rates
- **Code Quality**: More robust implementations with proper fallback mechanisms
- **Reliability**: Eliminated cascading failures from improper intermediate validation 
- **Performance**: Maintained processing speed while improving null-elimination effectiveness
- **Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved with no breaking changes
